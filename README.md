# Comment_digger
Chrome Extension that digs out HTML/CSS/JS comments and categorizes them


### Function to implement:
* Parsing through the HTML and pickup the comments defined between <!-- and -->
* Parsing through CSS and JS files and pick up comments defined between /* and */
* Add logic and understand whats inside those comments and define if it falls in one of these categories:
    * Dev comments (technical stuff and links/notes)
    * unused code from Devs
    * funny comments/ easterEggs
    * sensible infos
    * swear words/ unprofessional comments

### Considerations
Ideally want to add a pop-up or a sidebar as a view for the various groups
